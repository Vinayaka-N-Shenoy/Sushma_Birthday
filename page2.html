    <div class="calss1"><p>There can only be one Kohinoor and likewise are you. You are a rare gem. A gem that inspires us and motivates us to reach the maximum heights with every single syllable you produce. You have always listened to every single one of us during the fireside chats and given a positive thought about all those incidents we have come across. Youâ€™re always there when any of us need you. Ready to help us in every aspect. 
On this special day of yours, we wish you everlasting joy and happiness. We wish all thy future goals come true.
Happy birthday to our Ever inspiring Mentor, Sushma!</br></br>
Best wishes,</br>Team Ayusheer
